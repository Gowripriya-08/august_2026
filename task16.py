# #Problem 1: Using break in a While Loop
# Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input numbers = [25, 30,
# 20, 40, 15, 25] and prints the sum of the numbers. However, if the sum exceeds
# 100, stop adding numbers and print "Sum exceeded 100".

    if(sum>100):
        print("the sum exceeds 100")
        break

# Write a Python script that uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to
# 600. Print only the odd numbers, skipping the even ones using the continue
# statement

# print the word.
